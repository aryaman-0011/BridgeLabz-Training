/*
 2. SmartLibrary – Auto-Sort Borrowed Books (Insertion Sort)
Story: A digital kiosk in a library maintains a list of books a user has borrowed. Every time a
new book is issued, the system adds it to the user's list while keeping it alphabetically sorted
by title. Since insertions are done one at a time, and the list is usually already sorted, Insertion
Sort is the perfect fit.

Concepts Involved:
● Insertion Sort
● Dynamic list insertion
● Nearly sorted data
